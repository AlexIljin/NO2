- Styling at EOF works wihtout a hitch.
- Implemented partial styling to improve performance.
- Improved performance by using the Scintilla direct access functions.
- Used XDS Profiler to improve performance of the scanner itself.
- Created Unicode version of the plugin.

Version 0.2, 05 Dec 2009.
User-visible changes:
- REAL constants are now fully supported in all forms.
- Number parsing became more sophisticated, with more corner cases handled.
- Added support for wing comments inside compiler pragmas.
- Comments inside pragmas are now highlighted as pragma, not comment.
Introduced drawbacks:
- The last few tokens of a file are not styled (e.g. an unclosed comment
  lasting to the EOF is considered one big token).
- A file gets fully restyled on every pass (i.e. after every keypress).
