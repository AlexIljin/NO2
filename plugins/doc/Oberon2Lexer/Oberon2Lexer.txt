Oberon2Lexer v0.3 - freeware open-source plugin for Notepad++.

INTRODUCTION

This Notepad++ plugin provides a Scintilla Lexer for XDS Oberon-2 programming
language.

INSTALLATION AND SETUP

To use this plugin you have to copy two files. If you are using the ANSI
version of Notepad++, you should copy:
- file 1: Oberon2Lexer.dll to Notepad++\plugins\;
- file 2: Config\Oberon2Lexer.xml to Notepad++\plugins\Config\.
If you are using the Unicode version of Notepad++, you should copy:
- file 1: Oberon2LexerU.dll to Notepad++\plugins\;
- file 2: Config\Oberon2LexerU.xml to Notepad++\plugins\Config\.

Both target folders are to be found either in "Program Files" or in
"Application Data" of your current user, that depends on whether you installed
Notepad++ in the Portable mode or not. (Hint: to determine whether Notepad++
is installed in Portable mode, check for the existence of "doLocalConf.xml"
file in the folder next to Notepad++.exe. If the file is present, Portable
mode is in effect, otherwise it is not.) If you are still not sure what to do,
just copy the files to both "Program Files" and "Application Data".

If the Oberon2Lexer plugin is installed, you will see the "Oberon-2" item in
the "Languages" menu, and "Oberon-2 Lexer" submenu in the "Plugins" menu.

To change the highlighting styles (colours, fonts, etc.) use the standard
"Settings - Styler Configurator..." dialog. Your settings will be stored in
Notepad++\plugins\Config\Oberon2Lexer[U].xml. When a file is being handled by
the plugin, you should see the text "Oberon-2 source file" in the status bar.

The following styles are available:
Unsafe - currently only the keyword SYSTEM is highlighted with this style;
Flow breaker - the keywords EXIT, RETURN and HALT;
Keyword - all the predefined identifiers I could remember, except the ones
  mentioned in the "Unsafe" and "Flow breaker" styles;
Number - REAL ("E" and "D" notations supported) and INTEGER constants,
  including the hexadecimal ones with the "H" suffix;
String - 'quoted', "double-quoted" string constants and the hexadecimal
  character constants with the "X" suffix;
Comment - (* block comments (* with arbitrary nesting level *) *) and -- wing
  comments are supported;
Compiler option - <* the XDS syntax (* even with comments inside *) *>;
Error - this style is used for unterminated strings, comments, compiler
  pragmas, invalid number constants, invalid characters (such as %, @, $),
  etc.;
Default - everything else, i.e. normal identifiers, valid symbols and
   whitespace.
