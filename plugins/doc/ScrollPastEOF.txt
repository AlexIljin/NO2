ScrollPastEOF v.1.0 - freeware open-source plugin for Notepad++.

This plugin simply configures the Scintilla components on startup to allow scrolling up to one page down past the end of file. Currently (as of Notepad++ 5.6.2) there is no GUI setting to enable this feature. It may be added at a later time, but if you are using an older version, you may still want to use this plugin.

Installation. To use this plugin you have to copy the ScrollPastEOF.dll for ANSI version or ScrollPastEOFUni.dll file for Unicode version into Notepad++\plugins\ folder. To disable the plugin either delete/remove the file from the plugins folder or change the .dll extension (e.g. to .bak).
